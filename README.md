## Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è

Starting from version 1.5, Tasky package name is being changed to `com.thatsmanmeet.taskyapp` 
from `com.thatsmanmeet.tasky` because someone have uploaded my app to Play Store without changing
package name and hence I have to rename my app to upload it to Play Store.

So, please remove your old version of tasky and download the new one as this will also be available
on Play Store.

I am really sorry for this inconvenience.
